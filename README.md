# ML-Project-Eleven
Objective:
Build a regression model that predicts Parkinson’s disease severity (total_UPDRS) from voice-based acoustic features.

“To avoid data leakage caused by multiple recordings per patient, the dataset was split at the subject level using GroupShuffleSplit.”

“A linear regression model was used as a baseline and significantly outperformed a naïve mean predictor, indicating that voice features contain predictive information about disease severity.”
